Scrinium - An ebook reader for net-connected phones
-----------------------

* About

I hacked this together several years ago when I wanted to read a book on my phone.  I had unlimited data, a web browser but no decent app for reading books. (Sidekick II if you are curious)

Now I'm using a Blackberry Pearl and find that existing ebook readers for the platform are lacking, so I'm dusting this off and using it again.  This app works simply by reading a directory of text files and allowing you to read them in an easy to view format.  This program will let you view a file one page at a time and bookmark your location.

* Usage

The program by default reads the current directory for anything with a .txt extension.  Changing this is easy, just follow the comments in the code. Create a subdirectory in your web space, upload the index.php and text files you wish to read.  Once that is done, simply go to that url and start reading.

No security is provided by default,   placing the script in a directory not linked from anywhere should do the trick,  .htaccess voodoo will work if you are more paranoid.
